4. City
5. Shape (of UFO)

## Requirements

## Results

[Link to Website](https://srfassihi.github.io/UFOs/)

### Challenges
1. CSS did not always work well with the d3 library components. Had to do more customization using the index.html file than desired.
2. Filter Search took time to figure out from coding perspective. Initially hung up on the event part for updating the filters. Need more understanding on events and how to interact with d3 objects.
